The folder contains the code used to analyse data from GnomAD v4. Other databases, such as FLOSSIES, ONCOKB, and dbNSFP, were used to annotate and compare the data with GnomAD. 
In each gene file, eg. ATM.Rmd, the data from GnomAD was loaded and filtered for population-private variants for each population. A distribution table for each population was created using the number of variants in ClinVar displaying the variant type and the number in each ClinVar annotation. After this, a bar graph was created to show the number of population-private variants and variants that were shared among populations for each population.
In frequency graph.Rmd, allele counts were grouped into ranges (0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-10, 11-100 & 100+) to visualise the data better. The number of variants in each range categorised by their ClinVar annotation, was displayed using histograms and stacked bar charts. The variant counts were then converted into percentages within each range and were used to display the distribution of ClinVar annotation through normalised stacked bar charts. The distribution of variants in the 0-1 range among the population was then visualised using normalised stacked bar charts.
In v4 Figures.Rmd, the code for all of the graphs and tables used for the paper was written in this. While v4 Tables.Rmd had only the percentage of variants in ClinVar for frameshift, stop lost, and splice site variants combined and missense variants. It also included tables of Fisher's exact test results for the combined variants and a breakdown of selected figures.
