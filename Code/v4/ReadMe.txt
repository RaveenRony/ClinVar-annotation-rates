The folder contains the code used to analyse data from GnomAD v4. Other databases, such as FLOSSIES, ONCOKB, and dbNSFP, were used to annotate and compare the data with GnomAD. 
Population-private variants were filtered, analysis was performed on each of the nine genes, and data from GnomAD v2 was compared to GnomAD v4. dbNSFP was employed to annotate missense variants, and violin plots and bar graphs were created to visualise the data. 
Frequency graphs were created using allele counts to visualise the rarity of each variant.
Ken Doig used other databases to supply several scores for each variant which was filtered down and used to create PCA for each gene.\
Code for the figures and tables that were used in the paper were written in the v4Figures.rmd and v4Tables.rmd.
