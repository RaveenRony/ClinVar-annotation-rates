This folder contains the code used to analyse data received from Ken. 
For the scores given by Ken, all variants were annotated in hgvs.g format using GnomAD IDs. After the output was received, the files were loaded and used to analyse and create PCAs using data from dbNSFP rankscores aggregated by MyVariant for each gene.
The distribution of the population-private variants that are unreported on ClinVar from GnomAD that is present in OncoKB was observed as well.
