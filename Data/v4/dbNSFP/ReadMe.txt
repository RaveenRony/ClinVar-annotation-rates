This folder contains the input given to dbNSFP and output for each file from dbNSFP.
Input files were made using code in dbNSFP.Rmd. Each file was separated based on their gene and ClinVar annotation. For example, the variants in ATM gene would be separated into 4 files, atm_ben (containing benign variants), atm_path (containing pathogenic variants), atm_blank (containing unreported variants) and atm_vus (containing uncertain variants). This was done for each gene.
Algorithms selected for the results recieved were 1. Basic Information, 2. HGVSc/HGVSp presentation, 3. Transcript annotation, 4. Codon annotation, 5. SIFT, 6. Polyphen2, 7. MutationAssessor, 8. FATHMM, 9. VEST4, 10. MetaSVM/MetaLR, 11. REVEL, 12. CADD, 13. GERP++, 14. AlphaMissense.
Output folder contains the results collected when the variants were inputted into dbNSFP.
